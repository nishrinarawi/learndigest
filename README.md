## **Background and Issues**

Education plays a vital role in the development of a country. Quality and accessible education is key to improving the welfare of society and the nation's competitiveness. However, in Indonesia, there is a significant disparity in access to quality education and digital resources between urban and remote areas. This disparity is evident from the lack of teachers in remote areas, which forces teachers to handle and manage more students than the ideal number, resulting in an excessive workload for teachers in remote areas.

## **Project Goals and Success Criteria**

To address this disparity, we plan to develop a website that provides access to learning called **LearnDigest**. This website aims to help teachers improve efficiency in teaching students and provide educational accessibility for everyone. The website will be equipped with video transcription and summary features, ensuring everyone can obtain equal and quality knowledge. The success of this project will be measured using the SMART method with the following criteria:

- **Specific:** Increase the interest in learning among students who have not had the opportunity to receive a good education.
- **Measurable:** Increase the number of students participating in online learning programs by 20% within 6 months.
- **Achievable:** Provide transcriptions and summaries for videos to be included on the website.
- **Relevant:** This project aligns with the goals of the Ministry of Education and Culture, which aims to achieve equitable and quality education.
- **Time-Bound:** The website development will take 4 weeks.

## **Target Audience**

The target audience for this project includes:

1. **Teachers:** Teachers can use this application to provide learning materials in a text format that is more easily accessible by students, helping to address the educational disparity caused by the non-ideal teacher-to-student ratio.

2. **Students and Students with Hearing Disabilities:** This application will help students who want to learn more efficiently by reading summaries instead of watching long videos. The application will also be very beneficial for students with hearing disabilities, enabling them to access video content in text format.

## **Expected Benefits**

1. **Time Efficiency:** Students can save time by reading summaries instead of watching full videos.
2. **Accessibility:** Learning materials become more easily accessible in text format, especially for students with hearing impairments.
3. **Improved Understanding:** Students can easily understand and absorb key points from the learning materials.
4. **Support for Teachers:** Teachers can more easily provide structured and concise learning materials for students.

## **Conclusion**

By developing a website called **LearnDigest** that provides complete learning access with transcription and summary features, this project aims to help teachers deliver the best education possible. By expanding accessibility through digital technology, it is hoped to increase learning opportunities and the quality of education for all groups, including students from low-income families, individuals with disabilities, and those who have dropped out of school.
